HOW TO USE:
  - Make sure you have already run "make" from the "proj1" directory.
  - Run "bash runtests.sh" from the "boattest" directory.
  - The output will indicate success or failure, but you can look for more
    detail in the "testinglogs" directory.

COMPATIBILITY:
  - runtests.sh was only tested with bash.
  - It requires Python (2 or 3) and Vim.

WHAT IT DOES:
    This script makes copies of Boat.java and ThreadedKernel.java and changes
their selfTest methods for testing, then compiles those files and replaces the
existing .class files. The original .java files are not modified.

It tests multiple boat simulations with different numbers of adults and
children. For each configuration, it runs a simulation, and tests the result
for correctness (as specified in our design doc) using boattest.py. Results
are saved in the "simlogs" and "testlogs" directories.

EXAMPLES:
    To see how boattest.py works, look at each of the files in the "examples"
directory and run "python3 boattest.py [FILENAME]" on them.

CLEANUP:
  - The original source files are not modified, so running "make" again
    restores prior behavior.
  - Log files and temporary files made by runtests.sh can be cleaned up using
    clean.sh.

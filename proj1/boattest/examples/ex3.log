This example should fail, and no dinosaur will appear.

 ***Testing Boats with 2 children, 2 adults***
**Adult rowing to Molokai.
**Child rowing to Oahu.

More log data could go here, but it won't be examined because testing stops

The testing script won't even read any lines after the first failure, so none of this stuff appears in the "ignored lines" output.

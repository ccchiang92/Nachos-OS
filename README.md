# Nachos-OS
Implement functionalities and improve performance of a bare bone instructional OS call Nachos. The project focuses on two parts, thread management and multiprogramming. For thread management, I worked on methods and classes such as joining threads, condition variables, yield timers and thread scheduler. For multiprogramming, I worked on methods and classes such as system calls like exec, exit, and join. Along with virtual memory implementation and file system calls such as open, read, create and close. This project was a five man project done in JAVA with eclipse and ran on UNIX systems.
